<p>As we discover hundreds of planets in our galactic "backyard" - many of which are potentially habitable - it becomes evident that planetary systems around stars are the rule, not the exception. The free-floating dust from exploded stars and nebulae wants to coalesce into larger and larger bodies, under the force of gravity. So we wonder if life may also be the rule, not the exception, throughout our known universe. And if habitable niches are abundant enough, how abundant might intelligent life be, given the expansiveness of the Universe?</p>

<p>The idea of Active-SETI (or METI - Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) is a topic that's seen increased debate over the last few decades. While the purpose of SETI is to passively listen for signals from beyond our stellar system, proponents of Active-SETI argue that we should start the conversation if we hope to hear anything. Critics of Active-SETI warn that it's potentially dangerous and irresponsible to broadcast the location of Earth to unknown parties. They note that in our own history, when advanced civilizations have made contact with more primative societies, it's often been to the detriment of the lesser-advanced. Active-SETI proponents have countered that we've already been broadcasting our location into space since the advent of radio communications. The debate continues, thusly. </p>

<p>Cosmic Beacon acknowledges the validity of such debate, but puts it aside to ask another set of questions: if we did send out targeted, intentional messages, what would we -- the general public -- have to say? What questions would we ask? Considering the vast distances involved, how would we conduct a conversation? Would the same person who asked a question be around to hear its response?</p>
